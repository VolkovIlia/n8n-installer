## Critical Validation Requirements

### Before v1.0 Release (Pilot Testing)

| Hypothesis | Validation Method | Status | Blocker |
|------------|-------------------|--------|---------|
| **A1**: WireGuard bypasses Russian DPI | Test from Russian IP (3 attempts) | ⏳ REQUIRED | YES - Core value prop |
| **A2**: Telegram bot accessible in Russia | Test bot API from Russian IP | ⏳ REQUIRED | YES - Primary UX |
| **A6**: VPN doesn't break n8n services | Regression test after install | ⏳ REQUIRED | YES - Non-negotiable |
| **A3**: 8GB RAM sufficient | Resource profiling (20 clients + n8n) | ⏳ RECOMMENDED | NO - Conservative limits |

**Pilot Test Criteria**:
- ✅ WireGuard connection succeeds from Russian IP
- ✅ Telegram bot responds to commands from Russian IP
- ✅ n8n workflows continue working after VPN install
- ✅ Resource usage <6GB RAM, <80% CPU under max load

**If A1 or A2 fails**: PIVOT required (see hypothesis.v1.json pivot triggers)
